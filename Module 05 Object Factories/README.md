## Instructions
Modify your Battleship game from assignment 3.1 based on the feedback that you received. Make sure that -1 (or some other reasonable input) quits that game. Use abstract factories in the project as appropriate. For the purpose of this assignment, a good way to tell when you need a factory is if you have many subclasses from the same base class. Here are two such examples:

- Player
- Tile
As a reminder, please keep the following things in mind as you work:

- Classes should have one responsibility.
- Make sure you review GAP coding standards.
- Use virtual destructors on classes that you intend to be base classes.

## Purpose
To expand your STL experience to a new data structure, and more importantly, to see the difference both in terms of amount of code necessary and its efficiency when an appropriate data structure is used.

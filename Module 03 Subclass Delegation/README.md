## Instructions
In the provided zip file, you've been given the skeleton of a simple game of Battleship. It is your job to complete the code so that the game actually plays. There are further instructions in the main assignment .cpp file. In short, you'll need to:

- Refactor the game into a singleton.
- Leverage subclass delegation (not just inheritance) to create an AI player.
- Hide the ships until they are hit.
- Note that currently both the player and the AI are aiming for the same ships. Bonus   improvements include creating two boards (one for each player) and making it so that the AI does not guess the same coordinates.

## Purpose
To demonstrate a good understanding of basic architecture and inheritance via creation of a Battleship game.

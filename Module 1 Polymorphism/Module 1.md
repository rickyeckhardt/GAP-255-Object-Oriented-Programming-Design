# Instructions
The given code in the supplied zip file will not run, though the main function is stubbed in. You must complete the code so that it runs. The basic overview is that you must create a Shape interface that defines a single purely virtual method, CalculateArea (that returns a float). 

## You should then create three classes implementing the interface:
- Circle (constructor takes in an int radius and Point center)
- Triangle (constructor takes in three Points for the vertices)
- Rectangle (constructor takes in a Point for the top left corner, int width, int height)

## Purpose
To demonstrate an understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.
